Today I've started migrating my old (and ongoing) blogs over to a Jekyll blog hosted on github pages. The reasons for this change are that I found the Google hosting to be a bit too restrictive, difficult to maintain, and yet another Google service I could do without.

Apart from the initial Jekyll build command I've been able to do most of the configuration and this post from a mobile device.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
